        This site is interesting with utalizing images of what they sell. Such as the image of washing a 
        dirt bike to advertise their spring sale. Great example for featuring the sale and place the next 
        step for the user to input their bike information to find products specific for their bike.

        <p>    
        I find National Geographic covers alot of the different principles, but on their open page of their 
        site, this caught my attention.The contrast of the font colors and the photo play well together. 
        Complimenting colors, balanced fonts and visually appealing.

        <p>    
        What convinced me to check out this site, was this photo. They did a good job at fitting the
        elements of the image with a focal point. Well balanced with the couple and scenery of New Zealand.
        Made me want to read more about their experience and advice.
